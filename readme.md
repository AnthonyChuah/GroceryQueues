This program will simulate a grocery store with N checkout counters, serving a randomly-generated population of shoppers who appear at a certain rate.

These shoppers have a random number of items to process.

Servicing a shopper requires time that increases linearly with the number of items to process.

Shopper dissatisfaction increases increasingly with wait time: a 1 min wait is not much worse than a 30 secs wait, but a 5 min wait will make him really unhappy.

The program will display the average wait time, average shopper dissatisfaction, given a certain number N of checkout counters and a certain number of shoppers who arrive during a 2 hour window.
